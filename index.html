        A crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough

    <p> 
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin. 
        As legend has it, the croissant was invented as a special roll in Vienna to celebrate the end of its invasion by Turkish
        troops from the Ottoman Empire in 1683. The enemy decided to attack at night to avoid being seen, but the Viennese
        bakers, who were working at the time, realized the city was under siege and alerted the authorities.
    <br>
    <br>
        To immortalize this victory, a baker with the name of Peter Windletter was selected to create the H√∂rnchen (‚Äúsmall horn‚Äù
        in German), with the shape of a crescent to symbolize the Ottoman flag and emblem. By eating this roll the people in
        Vienna celebrated symbolically their victory over their feared enemy. Marie-Antoinette d‚ÄôAutriche, originally from
        Vienna, officially introduced and promoted the popularity of the croissant in France, starting in the late 1700s.
